    <p>Leo is about a year and a half and Archie just turned 4 months. Alhough their breeds could not be more different, they are the best of friends. They share treats, toys and even beds. They love going for long walks on the beach and to different parks. Archie is the tiniest at 7lbs and Leo comes in at about 60lbs. They are the best duo around and show each other love every day.
